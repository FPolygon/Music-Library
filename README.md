# Music-Library
This program allows users to manage and interact with a music library. Users can perform various operations
such as loading music data from a file, exporting the library to a file, viewing statistics, searching for
specific songs or artists, and more. The program uses a map to store albums, where each album contains
information about the artists and tracks.
